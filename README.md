## Layouts

Elbowpatched Boilerplate currently only has one template that you can use: 
[Albertine](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/albertine.html).
Feel free to modify it to your needs.
I will add more layouts as this project progresses.

If you want to create a new template, take a look at 
[Albertine](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/albertine.html) 
for inspiration. 
The [Templates documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) on the Jekyll site and
[Liquid Basics](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics) 
are good introductions to Liquid, the template language of Jekyll.
